# **RideInsights: Data-Driven Exploration of Uber Trip Patterns**

## **Overview**
This project leverages Uber trip data to perform a comprehensive analysis of trip patterns, user behavior, and trip characteristics. By cleaning and exploring the dataset, the project highlights insights into trip categories, purposes, and temporal trends, providing a foundation for business and operational improvements.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values and converted timestamps for ease of analysis.
  - Derived new features like day-night classification and month labels.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized trip distribution by purpose and category.
  - Analyzed daily, monthly, and time-of-day trends.
  - Highlighted outliers and their impact on trip distances using box plots.

- **Behavioral Insights**:
  - Identified peak times, days, and purposes for trips.
  - Explored mileage distributions and their seasonal variations.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## **Key Steps**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filled missing values in the `PURPOSE` column with a placeholder.
   - Converted `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` into datetime objects for temporal analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted features like `DAY`, `MONTH`, and `TIME` for trend analysis.
   - Created a `DAY-NIGHT` classification based on hourly bins.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Used bar plots, line charts, and box plots to represent trends and detect anomalies.
   - Investigated mileage outliers with boxplots and distribution curves.
